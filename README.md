## Context
As part of Quantium’s retail analytics team, we have been approached by a client named Julia, the Category Manager for Chips of a local grocery store, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behavior within the region.

The insights will feed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

Julia has asked us to also test the impact of the new trial layouts with a data driven recommendation to whether or not the trial layout should be rolled out to all their stores.


## Deliverables



## Summary Results
* Analyzed client’s chips transactional data set in R to identify customer purchasing behaviours (Task 1).

* Generated insights and provided commercial recommendations. Identified benchmark stores based on Pearson Correlations
and Magnitude Distance measures to test the impact of the trial store layouts on customer sales (Task 2).

* Presented a comprehensive client report in PowerPoint, introducing the actionable results first then getting into the why’s
and how’s. (Task 3).

* Communicated statistical evidence to client, confirming the success of the trial layout, and recommended its deployment
across all stores.
